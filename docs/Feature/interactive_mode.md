blz comes with an _interactive_ mode, this lets you try stuff out right from the command line.

To start the interactive mode, run `blz -i`

From here, you can import or require packages using `import Package` or `require File`

There is no support for blocks (if, for, while, functions, etc...) currently in the interactive mode, but it will come eventually.
