# Welcome to the blz docs site

blz is a language designed to help developers produce fast, maintainable code by building best practices into the runtime.

Specifically blz aims to:

 * Reduce the complexity of getting code up and running
 * Reduce the number of edge cases that a programmer needs to consider
 * Enable efficient testing
 * Provide fast standard libraries
 * Allow code to be understood without needing to jump back and forth through several files
