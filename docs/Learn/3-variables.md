**Lesson 3: Variables**

So far, we've learned how to manipulate basic values, but you can also store them in variables.

Variables are easy to work with in blz. You simply use the assignment operator `=`

```
> variable = "value "
value
> variable + variable
value value
> array = [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
> array[1] + array[2]
5
```

Notice in this, we stored an array as a value.

We then accessed the value at the 1st and 2nd index (2nd and 3rd position) by using the array lookup operator `[index]`
