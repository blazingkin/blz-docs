**Lesson 1: Hello World**

Now that you've got your blz environment set up, let's write our first program.

Open a new file in a text editor. Call it `hello.blz`.


```
print("Hello, *Your Name*")
```

Go ahead and save that.

With a command prompt, navigate to where the file is.

Now run `blz hello.blz`

You should see:
```
Hello, *Your Name*
```

If you do, great! You've just written your first line of blz and you are ready to move on to the next lesson!

If not, make sure that you followed all of the installation steps correctly.

If you get some kind of error that seems to be coming from blz, post the error on the [blz issues page](https://github.com/blazingkin/blz-ospl/issues) with logs and you can get help.
